# React Notes

Before talking about **React**:

- Have you started a React project already?
- Have you built a website before? (knowledge of html/css/js)
- Is this for a mobile app?
- React relies on Node.js
  - Node is a JavaScript runtime environment/compiler for building full-size JavaScript projects
  - npm (node package manager) helps us build and run projects, including react projects
  - Pros: frameworks running on Node make development much easier + good documentation
  - Cons: Node projects can take up a lot of space and may not be optimal for older systems

React is a framework on top of Node that makes it easier to make front-ends for websites. Makes it easier by:

1. Consolidating html/css/js all into just javascript
2. Making web development into an object oriented programming approach
   - You create reusable React Components that can be easily refactored into many parts of a website

## Hello World in React

First, ensure node is installed and navigate to the folder which you want to create the React App within
